            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHereas the late King <hi>James</hi> the Second, without any Evil Counſellours, Wicked Judges, or Miniſters, through Folly or Wickedneſs, hath been miſled into Arbitrary Deſigns againſt the Government and himſelf, thereby becoming obnoxious to the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom; and the ſaid King having broke the Original Contract between King and People, for which he Abdicated the Government, and the Throne thereby became Vacant. And, Whereas it is incident to Kings and Princes, being got on the Throne, to thirſt after Arbitrary Power by the help of Flatterers, to their own Ruin and Deſtruction: And for that, though ſtrict Enquiry hath been made after his Accomplices, yet none of them can be found out; and it appearing plain, that the ſaid late King did all on his own Head, for the deſtroying of Charters, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99139:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>murdering his Subjects contrary to Law; Therefore, foraſmuch as doubts may ariſe about the matters aforeſaid, and to the End, that the wonted Clemency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation may be perpetually had in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as well Abroad as at Home:</p>
            <p>Be it Enacted, by the King and Queen's Majeſty, by and with the Conſent and Advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame; That the ſaid late King <hi>James</hi> be Pardoned, Indemnified, and Saved harmleſs from all Pains, Penalties and Forfeitures whatſoever, for, and by reaſon of any Miſdeeds, or Omiſſions by him made heretofore, contrary to the Laws of the Land whatſoever, until the 25th of <hi>December</hi> laſt paſt: And be it Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that it may be lawful to and for their preſent Majeſties, not only to Retain, and Keep in their moſt ſecret Councils, Places of Truſt, and Offices, whatſoever, any of the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Servants, Counſellours, or Officers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but alſo, the ſaid King <hi>James,</hi> (if their Majeſties ſhall think fit) for the more ſecure Setling and Confirming Their Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Government of theſe Kingdoms, againſt Popery and Arbitrary Power, to entertain the ſaid late King <hi>James,</hi> in any Place of Truſt, or Profit whatſoever, Provided, the ſaid King <hi>James,</hi> and all his Friends and Relations, which ſhall be Employed by Their Preſent Majeſties, ſhall take the new Oaths, mentioned in an Act of this Preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Since the Generoſity of the Nation is ſuch, as to forgive ſuch ſmall Offences as Parliament Penſioners to Sell the Nation, to Introduce Popery and Arbitrary Power, to Deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render Charters, to Root out Corporations, and thereby the Antient Conſtitution of theſe Kingdoms; Evil and Wicked Counſellours did all that in them lay, to Aſſiſt the late King, to make this Nation as <hi>France,</hi> and to forgive the very Actors in Murders by a pretence of Law, and to make King <hi>James</hi> the only ſcape-Goat run into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Incurring the Sins of the whole Nation. It ſeems to me reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and I doubt not, it will be ſo to you, that an Act of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may paſs in this Houſe, this Seſſions, for the late King <hi>James;</hi> and therefore, as an honeſt man guided by Truſt and Juſtice, I have ſent you ready drawn a Bill of Indempnity for him, as well as for the reſt, and do hope it will, by the good favour of this Houſe, paſs into a Law; in order to which, I hope you will lend your helping Hand, and Communicate the ſame to the Houſe; and if you find any bawl at it, as ſome may do, get but a Ballotting Box, and I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, the major part of this Houſe will be for paſſing this good Bill.</p>
